HOW TO HANDLE MAPPING FILE FOR GOOGLE PLAY STORE
==================================================

After enabling minification (isMinifyEnabled = true), the mapping file will be generated when you build a release AAB/APK.

LOCATION OF MAPPING FILE:
--------------------------
When you build release, the mapping file will be generated at:
app/build/outputs/mapping/release/mapping.txt

HOW TO BUILD RELEASE AAB:
--------------------------
./gradlew bundleRelease

The mapping.txt file will be generated in:
app/build/outputs/mapping/release/mapping.txt

HOW TO UPLOAD TO GOOGLE PLAY:
------------------------------
1. Build the release AAB: ./gradlew bundleRelease
2. Find mapping.txt at: app/build/outputs/mapping/release/mapping.txt
3. Upload AAB to Google Play Console
4. When uploading, Google Play will ask for "Deobfuscation file" - upload the mapping.txt file
5. The warning will disappear after uploading the mapping file

IMPORTANT NOTES:
----------------
- The mapping file is specific to each build. You MUST upload the mapping.txt that matches the exact AAB you're uploading.
- If you rebuild, a new mapping.txt will be generated - use the new one.
- Keep the mapping.txt file safe - you'll need it for crash reports analysis.
- The mapping file allows Google Play to deobfuscate stack traces for better crash analysis.

PROGUARD RULES:
---------------
We have comprehensive ProGuard rules in app/proguard-rules.pro that:
- Preserve Retrofit API parameter names (critical for API calls)
- Keep all necessary classes for app functionality
- Preserve line numbers for debugging
- Keep all required attributes for proper deobfuscation
