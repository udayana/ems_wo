    FileProvider Paths - Scoped Storage Only (No Permission Required)
    
    This app uses ONLY app-specific directories for storing work order photos.
    These directories are automatically cleaned when the app is uninstalled.
    
    PRIVACY & COMPLIANCE:
    - external-files-path: App-specific external directory
      Location: Android/data/com.sofindo.ems/files/
      Purpose: Store work order photos captured by users
      No permission required (Scoped Storage)
      
    - cache-path: App cache directory
      Location: /data/data/com.sofindo.ems/cache/
      Purpose: Temporary storage for image processing
      No permission required (Scoped Storage)
    
    USER BENEFIT:
    - Users capture photos to document THEIR OWN work order completion
    - Photos are for user's work documentation, not developer data collection
    - Users have full control over what to capture and submit
